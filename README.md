(what plans to be) an intuitive daw based on the Ableton DAW and Blender's nodes

to-do list
- finish basic layout
    - connecting nodes
    - create nodes that correlate with their webaudio counterparts
- implement nodes with sound
    - start with only a few nodes
- have the background image opacity pulse based on master audio

future plans so i don't forget!
- figure out a way to do automation
- implement a good file type fast, using xml? https://stackoverflow.com/a/48789575
- maybe, video/mp4 support with recording video? would be pretty useful...
- 
- vst support with vstjs?? have some free vsts pre installed 
    - vital (may be too laggy), or helm (eh...) 
    - BassAmp (definitely) https://www.airwindows.com/bassamp/ 
    - w1 limiter http://www.yohng.com/software/w1limit.html
    - other free plugins i can't think of,,
- group nodes and save groups of nodes
    - would be useful to import into other projects
- backend
    - use mongodb for storing files
    - implement collaboration with socket.io
- use tauri to make an os app?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOnf_kGI6L0 
    - idk if this is even like gonna be useful
    - maybe if i add collaboration features, but this requires backend which isn't supported in tauri 
    - using electron is way too bulky for this project! or maybe not?
    

so many more plans than to-do lol
